**Hidden Salon is a creative, relaxed hair salon based in Old Trafford, Manchester.**

Hidden Salon has emerged from my background in fine art and textile design, a passion for the aesthetically pleasing and my experience as a hair stylist.

I understand that we all have busy lives and finding time for yourself is sometimes difficult. I have created a professional mini salon to give you your own individual, relaxing and client centred experience.

I have an honours degree in Fine Arts and following this I turned my talents to art tutoring and window dressing. Later I tuned my artistry into the world of beauty, asthetics and colour and have now been a qualified hairdresser for 10 years. I was trained in Hedonist in Manchesterâ€™s Northern Quarter by a Tony and Guy professional and worked in a salon in Didsbury before setting up my own business.

I genuinely enjoy the company of people and pride myself on building a personal relationship with clients.  I take great care in client consultations and seek to bring out their personality and natural style. I pride myself on creating a style that maximises your time and needs minimal effort to recreate.

My salon is an extension of myself and my values, below are some things that are important to me:

* Family and friendship
* Warmth
* Cruelty free products
* Good coffee
* Fairness
* Environmentally conscious
* Supports independent local business
* Being part of the local community
